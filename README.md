# Image Inpainting using Multi-Scale Learned Dictionaries in the Wavelet Domain
Recent studies on sparse and redundant signal representations have shown trends to merge dictionary learning with multi-scale analytical frameworks such as wavelet or time- to-frequency transformations. Because most natural signals can be expressed at multiple scales, such approach is appealing by combining the advantages of fitting dictionaries more finely to real data and the expressiveness of multi-scale representations. In this paper, we extend the work on multi-scale dictionary learning to the paradigm of image inpainting and compare our result to existing techniques to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also identify the impact of different parameters of our model on our result through experiments.
